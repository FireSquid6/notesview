In this new paragraph I'm gonna do some *italics* for emphasis followed by some **bolded terms** and maybe even some new stuff ~~or perhaps not, it's a bad idea~~. Regardless, it can all be simplified by $f(x) = \sin(x) + 2 \cdot \Theta \pi$. This equation can also be implemented in some typescript code:


```ts
console.log("Hello world!");


function sum(n: number): number {
    let sum = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum += n;
    }
    return sum
}
```


We can also do some math blocks. The fundamental theorem of calculus is:

$$
\int_{a}^{b}f(x) dx = F(b) - F(a)
$$
