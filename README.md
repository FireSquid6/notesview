# Features
- Sleek and elegant UI
- Code syntax highlighting
- Latex rendering for math expressions
- Sidebar file browser


# Installation
Noteview's only dependency is [bun](https://bun.sh), which you'll need to install first. After that, just:


```bash
git clone https://github.com/firesquid6/noteview
cd noteview

./build/local-install.sh
```

After that, `noteview` will be in `~/.local/bin`. You should add this to your path if you haven't already by adding:

```bash
export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.local/bin"
```

To your `~/.bashrc` (other shells like fish or zsh will require different setup).
